                    <p>Many reports came through that Prince Hamlet was dating Ophelia, the daughter of Polonius, a close ally to King Claudius. They are often seen together and they could have been dating for as many as 3 months. Reports also say that Polonius is not pleased with the relationship and that he had warned Ophelia to stay away from the prince.</p>

                    <p>Reports from inside the royal family are saying that Hamlet has gone mad and that he is taking it out on Ophelia. Numerous strange actions from the prince have been reported from frantic speech to rejecting two of his closest friends. They say the person who has suffered the most from this is Ophelia. Hamlet told her that he did not love her and that she should get herself to a nunnery.</p>

                    <strong>3 Months before Royal Armageddon: Hamlet Kills Polonius</strong>
                </div>
                <div class="aText">
                    <p>In the most drastic action of his apparent madness, Prince Hamlet stabbed and killed Polonius,  the King’s ally and the father of Ophelia. Mass speculation surrounded this incident with many different motives. Some say it was an accident and that Hamlet was waving his knife around and Polonius accidentally walked in its path. Others say that Hamlet thought Polonius was his father, who has been potentially tied to the death of the late King Hamlet. The general consensus though, was that Hamlet purposely killed Polonius in a fit of rage over his interference with his relationship with Ophelia.</p>

                <div class="aText">
                    <p>There were reports that Polonius’s death and Hamlet’s rejection had driven Ophelia mad, but no one could have expected what came next. Ophelia drowned is an apparent suicide, although the royal family contended that she accidentally drowned after falling in a lake. Blame is thrown everywhere with Hamlet getting the brunt of it. She would have a proper Christian burial shortly after.</p>

                    <strong>Royal Armageddon: 4 Royals, including the three nearest to the crown, die in one night</strong>
                </div>
                <div class="aText">
                    <p>At Ophelia’s funeral, Prince Hamlet and Laertes, Ophelia’s brother, reportedly got into a fight over who truly loved Ophelia. This led to a sword duel that night and reports say Laertes plotted with King Claudius to poison his sword in order to kill Hamlet. On the night of the duel, Queen Gertrude was the first fatality after she drank poisoned wine that was part of another plot by King Claudius to kill Hamlet. During the duel, both Hamlet and Laertes were wounded by the poisoned sword. After learning that his uncle had tried to kill him, Hamlet killed King Claudius and then, along with Laertes, succumbed to the poison of the sword.</p>
